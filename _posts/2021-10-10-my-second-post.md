In N-dimensional simplex noise, the squared kernel summation radius $r^2$ is $\frac 1 2$
for all values of N. This is because the edge length of the N-simplex $s = \sqrt {\frac {N} {N + 1}}$
divides out of the N-simplex height $h = s \sqrt {\frac {N + 1} {2N}}$.
The kerel summation radius $r$ is equal to the N-simplex height $h$.

$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$

Well, it's late in the evening and thought I'd take another crack at this attempt to get a blog up and running.  As I near the end of the tutorial,
there's so much to write about I think I may now have writer's block -- I can't seem to decide what to write about first!I can't seem to decide what to
write about first!I can't seem to decide what to write about first!I can't seem to decide what to write about first!I can't seem to decide what to write about first!
